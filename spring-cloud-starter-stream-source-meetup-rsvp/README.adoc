= Meetup RSVP Stream

This source ingests data from Meetup RSVP's stream at http://stream.meetup.com/2/rsvps.
It uses the https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/rsvp/ for documenting the API.
See the docs for the list of parameters that can be passed. Currently the full stream without
parameters is being passed in.

You need to supply all keys and secrets (both consumer and accessToken) to authenticate for this source, so it is easiest if you just add these as the following environment variables: CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET.

== Options

curl https://api.meetup.com/rsvp/
   -F 'event_id=12345'
   -F 'rsvp=yes'
   -F 'key=YOURKEY'


NOTE: `meetup-rsvp` emits JSON, There is much more to the API than we have time to explore in this demo.
