= Meetup RSVP Stream

This source ingests data from Meetup RSVP's stream at http://stream.meetup.com/2/rsvps.
It uses the https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/rsvp/ for documenting the API.
See the docs for the list of parameters that can be passed. Currently the full stream without
parameters is being passed in.

== Options

curl https://api.meetup.com/rsvp/
   -F 'event_id=12345'
   -F 'rsvp=yes'
   -F 'key=YOURKEY'


NOTE: `meetup-rsvp` emits JSON, There is much more to the API than we have time to explore in this demo.
